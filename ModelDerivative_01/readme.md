This folder contains a Postman Collection with the requests used in the [Translate a Source File walkthrough](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/model-derivative/v2/tutorials/translate-to-obj/), which is published on the APS developer portal.

In the Postman sidebar, requests are stored in folders that have the same name as the corresponding task in the walkthrough on the APS developer portal.

Individual requests in Postman have been named such that the corresponding step in the walkthrough (on the APS developer portal) can be figured out easily.
