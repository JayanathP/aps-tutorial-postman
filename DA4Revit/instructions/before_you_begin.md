## 1. Import Postman Collections for the walkthrough

Postman Environments are named configurations that implement variables to store values you typically use across many HTTP requests. For example, APS's Base URL is stored in the environment variable `baseUrl`. To import the environment you need for this walkthrough:

1. Download the following zip file from the [*collections* folder](../collections) and expand it on your local machine.

    - _revit_collections.zip_
  
2. In the Postman header bar, click **Import**. A dialog displays.

3. Drag the files you expanded in step 1 to the area marked **Drop files here**. Alternatively, you can click **Choose Files** and pick the files you expanded in step 1.

4. Click the **Environment drop-down** on the upper-right, and select **DA4Revit**. The DA4Revit environment loads.
