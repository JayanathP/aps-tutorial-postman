# Task 4 - Upload an AppBundle to Design Automation

An AppBundle is a package of binaries and supporting files that make up a Revit add-in. See the corresponding [task in the Step-by-Step tutorial on the APS developer portal](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/design-automation/v3/tutorials/revit/step4-publish-appbundle/) for an explanantion of AppBundles and learn how to create an AppBundle. For the purpose of this Postman tutorial,  download *DeleteWallsApp.zip*, which is stored in the [*tutorial_data* folder of this repository](../tutorial_data). The file *DeleteWalls.dll* that is contained within this AppBundle is designed to run on Revit 2018.

## Register the AppBundle

When registering the AppBundle, you inform Design Automation that you want to name it DeleteWallsApp, and that it must run on Revit 2020.
**Note:** Screen captures show that the AppBundle runs on Revit 2018. However the Postman Collection has been updated to run on Revit 2020.

1. On the Postman sidebar, click **Task 4 - Upload AppBundle > POST Register the AppBundle**. The request loads.

2. Click the **Body** tab, and verify that the `id`, and `engine` are set to `DeleteWallsApp`, and `Autodesk.Revit+2020`.

3. Click **Send**. If the request is successful, you will see a screen similar to the following image:

    ![AppBundel Registered](../images/task4-appbundle_registered.png "AppBundel Registered")

    The `endpointURL` and `formData` information required to upload the AppBundle is saved to Postman Environment variables.

2. Click the **Body** tab. and note how `id` is set to`test`.

    ![Alias](../images/task4-appbundle_alias.png "Alias")

    ![Alias response](../images/task4-appbundle_alias_set.png "Alias response")

## Update an Existing AppBundle

2. Click the **Body** tab. Note that you are now specifying only the engine and description.

## Upload the updated AppBundle

1. On the Postman sidebar, click **Task 4 - Upload AppBundle > POST Upload the Updated AppBundle**. The request loads.

2. Click the **Body** tab, and scroll down such that the **file** row is visible.
