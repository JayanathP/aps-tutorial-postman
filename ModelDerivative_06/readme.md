This folder contains a Postman Collection with the requests used in the [Extract Geometry from a Source File walkthrough](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/model-derivative/v2/tutorials/xtract-geometry-from-source-file/).

In the Postman sidebar, requests are stored in folders that have the same name as the corresponding task in the walkthrough on the APS developer portal.
