This folder contains a Postman Collection that contains the requests used in the Model Derivative Step-by-Step Tutorial [Prepare a File for the Viewer](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/model-derivative/v2/tutorials/prep-file4viewer/), which is published on the APS developer portal.

In the Postman sidebar, requests are stored in folders that have the same name as the corresponding task in the tutorial on the APS developer portal.

Individual requests in Postman have been named such that the corresponding step in the tutorial (on the APS developer portal) can be figured out easily.
