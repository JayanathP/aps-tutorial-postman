# Task 3 â€“ Translate Source File

To display a model in the viewer, you must first translate the model to a viewer-friendly format. There are two such formats you can translate the source model to;
- The SVF format.
- The SVF2 format.

SVF is the format originally designed for the viewer. SVF2 format is an improved version of SVF. It is optimized for larger models so that they load faster at display time.

For details refer [Prepare Models for Online Viewing](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/model-derivative/v2/developers_guide/basics/preperation/) in the Model Derivative API Developer's Guide.
