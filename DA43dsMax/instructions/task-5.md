# Task 5 - Submit a WorkItem

When you submit a *WorkItem* to Design Automation, you are instructing Design Automation to execute the Activity specified in the WorkItem.


## Create a WorkItem

1. In the Postman sidebar, click **Task 5 - Submit a WorkItem > Send WorkItem**. The request loads.

2. Click the **Body** tab and take note of the JSON payload.

    ![WorkItem JSON Payload](../images/task5-workitem_json_payload.png "WorkItem JSON Payload")

    The main attributes on the JSON payload are:

    - `activityId` - Specifies what Activity to execute. The id you specify here must be a fully qualified id made up of three parts. They start with the Nickname of the app (or the Client Id of the app), followed by the '.' character, then the Activity name. This is followed by the '+' character and finally the Activity Alias. For more information on fully qualified ids and unqualified ids, see the [documentation on ids](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/design-automation/v3/developers_guide/aliases-and-ids/#ids).

    - `arguments` - Contains all the parameters needed by the Activity specified by `activityId`. They must match the parameters you specified in Task 3, when you created the Activity.

    - `InputMaxScene` - Specifies how to obtain the 3ds Max scene file for the Activity. It contains either the signed URL to the scene file, or a zip file that contains the scene file. This is followed by the HTTP verb that gets the file. If you uploaded a zip file in Task 4, use the `pathInZip` attribute to specify the relative path to the 3ds Max file. If you uploaded a 3ds Max file instead of a zip file, do not specify the `pathInZip` attribute.

    - `MaxscriptToExecute` - Specifies how to obtain the MAXScript file for the Activity. It contains the signed URL to download the MAXScript file.

    - `OutputZip` - Specifies the signed URL to the location reserved for the output of the activity, followed by the HTTP verb to use.

3. Click **Send**. Postman saves the WorkItem ID to the `dasWorkItemId` environment variable. If the request is successful you should see a screen similar to the following image.
